For an emoji selector application, several features could be considered essential to enhance usability and functionality. Here are some key features to consider:

1. Search functionality:
   This is perhaps the most crucial feature. With hundreds of emojis available, a search bar would allow users to quickly find specific emojis.

2. Emoji categories:
   Organizing emojis into categories (e.g., smileys, animals, food, etc.) makes navigation easier.

3. Recently used emojis:
   A section that shows the user's most recently or frequently used emojis for quick access.

4. Keyboard shortcuts:
   Allow users to open the selector and navigate through emojis using keyboard shortcuts.

5. Customizable hotkey:
   Let users set their preferred hotkey to open the emoji selector.

6. Clipboard integration:
   Ensure selected emojis are immediately copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.

7. Tooltip descriptions:
   Show emoji names or descriptions on hover to help users understand less obvious emojis.

8. Resizable window:
   Allow users to adjust the size of the emoji selector window.

9. Dark/Light mode:
   Respect system theme settings or allow users to toggle between dark and light modes.

10. Multi-emoji selection:
    Allow users to select multiple emojis at once for copying.

Let's start with implementing one of these features. Would you like to add search functionality or emoji categories first? These would significantly improve the usability of your application.

Thank you! I'm thrilled to hear that you're happy with the results. It's great when we can create something functional and tailored to your specific needs.

Now that we have a solid foundation for your emoji selector, here are some ideas for potential next steps:

1. Refine the UI:

   - Adjust the size and spacing of emoji buttons for better visibility
   - Add tooltips to show emoji names on hover

2. Enhance search:

   - Implement fuzzy search for more forgiving matching
   - Add category filtering alongside text search

3. Persistence:

   - Save recently used emojis for quick access
   - Allow users to mark favorites

4. Customization:

   - Add a settings dialog to customize appearance or behavior
   - Allow users to add custom emojis or modify the existing set

5. Hotkey functionality:

   - Implement a global hotkey to launch the app from anywhere

6. Performance optimization:

   - If you add many more emojis, you might want to implement lazy loading or virtual scrolling for smoother performance

7. Theming:

   - Add light/dark mode toggle or system theme detection

8. Clipboard history:
   - Keep a short history of copied emojis for quick re-use

Do any of these interest you, or do you have any other ideas you'd like to explore? We can dive deeper into any aspect of the application you find most exciting or useful.

That's fantastic news! I'm really glad to hear the application is working so well with the SQLite implementation. This setup should provide you with better performance and scalability, especially as you add more emojis or features to the application.

Since it's working well, here are some potential next steps or improvements you might consider:

1. Performance optimization: If you haven't already, you might want to add indexes to the SQLite database for faster searching, especially if you plan to include all 3,600+ emojis.

2. User customization: You could add a feature that allows users to add their own custom emojis to the database.

3. Categories: Implement a category filter to allow users to browse emojis by category.

4. Recently used: Keep track of recently used emojis for quick access.

5. Favorites: Allow users to mark and filter favorite emojis.

6. Keyboard shortcuts: Implement more keyboard shortcuts for power users.

7. Theming: Add light/dark mode support or allow users to customize the app's appearance.

8. Packaging: If you're considering distributing this to the Arch Linux community, you might want to look into creating an AUR package.

9. Documentation: Write a simple README or man page to help users understand how to use all the features.

Is there any particular area you'd like to focus on next, or any specific features you're thinking of adding?
