For an emoji selector application, several features could be considered essential to enhance usability and functionality. Here are some key features to consider:

1. Search functionality: 
   This is perhaps the most crucial feature. With hundreds of emojis available, a search bar would allow users to quickly find specific emojis.

2. Emoji categories: 
   Organizing emojis into categories (e.g., smileys, animals, food, etc.) makes navigation easier.

3. Recently used emojis: 
   A section that shows the user's most recently or frequently used emojis for quick access.

4. Keyboard shortcuts: 
   Allow users to open the selector and navigate through emojis using keyboard shortcuts.

5. Customizable hotkey: 
   Let users set their preferred hotkey to open the emoji selector.

6. Clipboard integration: 
   Ensure selected emojis are immediately copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.

7. Tooltip descriptions: 
   Show emoji names or descriptions on hover to help users understand less obvious emojis.

8. Resizable window: 
   Allow users to adjust the size of the emoji selector window.

9. Dark/Light mode: 
   Respect system theme settings or allow users to toggle between dark and light modes.

10. Multi-emoji selection: 
    Allow users to select multiple emojis at once for copying.

Let's start with implementing one of these features. Would you like to add search functionality or emoji categories first? These would significantly improve the usability of your application.
